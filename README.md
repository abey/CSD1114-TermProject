# CSD1114-TermProject
This was the Term Project for CSD-1114 (Web Technologies 1) Course that I had at Lambton College.

The objective of the Term Project was to create a non-Javascript static website for a store using Boostrap framework.
The website is to have Product lists, individual product pages, jumbotron, headers, about page, contact page and a page dedicated to give special offers.
The site is also responsive as it hides/shows sections based on device width.
